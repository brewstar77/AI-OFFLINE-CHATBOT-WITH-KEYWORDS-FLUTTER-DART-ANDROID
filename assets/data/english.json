        "question": "How do you identify the theme of a text?",

      {
        "question": "What is the difference between inference and direct information?",
        "answer": "Direct information is stated clearly by the author, like 'She was angry.' An inference is a conclusion you draw from hints—e.g. if she slammed a door and clenched her fist, you infer she’s angry."

      "question": "What is a pronoun and why do we use them?",
      "answer": "A pronoun is a word that takes the place of a noun or noun phrase (e.g., he, she, it, they, we, I, myself). We use them to avoid repeating the same nouns over and over, which makes sentences flow better and sound less repetitive."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between 'its' and 'it's'?",
      "answer": "'Its' (without an apostrophe) is a possessive pronoun, meaning it shows ownership (e.g., 'The dog wagged its tail.'). 'It's' (with an apostrophe) is a contraction for 'it is' or 'it has' (e.g., 'It's a beautiful day.' or 'It's been a long time.')."

      "question": "How can you make your writing more descriptive?",
      "answer": "To make your writing more descriptive, use vivid adjectives and adverbs. Appeal to the five senses (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch) by including sensory details. Use figurative language like similes (comparing using 'like' or 'as') and metaphors (comparing by saying one thing *is* another)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is point of view in a story?",
      "answer": "Point of view is the perspective from which a story is told. Common types include: \n**First person:** The narrator is a character in the story and uses 'I' or 'we' (e.g., 'I walked to the store.').\n**Third person limited:** The narrator is outside the story but tells it from the perspective of one character, knowing only their thoughts and feelings (e.g., 'He felt nervous.').\n**Third person omniscient:** The narrator is outside the story but knows the thoughts and feelings of all characters (e.g., 'She was excited, but he was worried.')."
    },

      "answer": "Some common punctuation marks include:\n**Period (.):** Ends a declarative sentence or an imperative sentence.\n**Question Mark (?):** Ends an interrogative sentence (a question).\n**Exclamation Mark (!):** Ends an exclamatory sentence or shows strong emotion.\n**Comma (,):** Used to separate items in a list, before a conjunction joining independent clauses, after introductory elements, and to set off nonessential clauses.\n**Apostrophe ('):** Used to show possession (e.g., 'John's book') or to indicate contractions (e.g., 'can't' for 'cannot')."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is figurative language? Give two examples.",
      "answer": "Figurative language is language that uses words or expressions with a meaning that is different from the literal interpretation. It's used to make descriptions more empathetic and vivid. Examples include:\n**Simile:** A comparison between two unlike things using 'like' or 'as' (e.g., 'He was as brave as a lion.').\n**Metaphor:** A direct comparison between two unlike things stating one thing *is* another (e.g., 'Her eyes were pools of blue.').\nOther examples include personification, hyperbole, and onomatopoeia."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can you identify the setting of a story?",
      "answer": "The setting of a story is the time and place where the events occur. Look for descriptions of the location (e.g., city, forest, specific building), the time period (e.g., past, present, future, specific year), and sometimes even the weather or social environment. The author often provides clues in the opening paragraphs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is it important to proofread your writing?",
