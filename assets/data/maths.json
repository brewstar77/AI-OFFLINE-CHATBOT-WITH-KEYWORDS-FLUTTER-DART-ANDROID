      "question": "How do we compare whole numbers?",
      "answer": "To compare whole numbers, we look at the digits from left to right starting with the largest place value. The number with the larger digit in the leftmost place is the greater number. If the digits are the same, we compare the next digit, and so on. For example, to compare 567 and 571, we see the hundreds digit (5) is the same. Then we compare the tens digit: 6 in 567 and 7 in 571. Since 7 is greater than 6, 571 is greater than 567."

For example, if a rectangle has a length of 5 cm and a width of 3 cm, its area is Length × Width = 5 cm × 3 cm = 15 cm²."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between perimeter and area?",
      "answer": "Perimeter is the distance around the outside of a 2D shape (like a fence around a garden), measured in linear units (e.g., meters). Area is the space inside that shape (like the amount of grass needed for the garden), measured in square units (e.g., square meters). A shape can have the same perimeter as another but a different area, and vice-versa."

      "answer": "To plot A (3, 4):\n1. Start at the origin (0,0), where the x-axis and y-axis intersect.\n2. The x-coordinate is 3, so move 3 units to the right along the x-axis.\n3. The y-coordinate is 4, so from that position on the x-axis, move 4 units up parallel to the y-axis.\n4. Mark this point. This is point A (3,4)."

      "question": "What is a factor of a number? What is a multiple of a number?",
      "answer": "A **factor** of a number is a whole number that divides exactly into that number without leaving a remainder. For example, the factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 because each of these numbers can divide 12 without a remainder.\nA **multiple** of a number is the result of multiplying that number by any whole number (1, 2, 3, etc.). For example, multiples of 3 are 3 (3×1), 6 (3×2), 9 (3×3), 12 (3×4), and so on."

      "question": "What is rounding numbers? How do you round 78 to the nearest ten?",
      "answer": "Rounding numbers means making a number simpler while keeping its value close to what it was. The result is less exact, but easier to use.\nTo round 78 to the nearest ten:\n1. Identify the tens digit (7, which means 70).\n2. Look at the next digit to the right (the ones digit, which is 8).\n3. If this digit is 5 or more, round up the tens digit. If it's 4 or less, keep the tens digit the same.\nSince 8 is 5 or more, we round up the 7 to 8. So, 78 rounds up to 80.\nSolution: 78 rounded to the nearest,"
