Understanding basic phonetic symbols can greatly improve pronunciation.\nKey areas:\n- Vowels: Sounds produced with an open vocal tract.\n- Consonants: Sounds produced with some obstruction in the vocal tract.\n- Diphthongs: A sound formed by the combination of two vowels in a single syllable, in which the sound begins as one vowel and moves towards another (e.g., 'oi' in coin, 'ai' in rain)."
